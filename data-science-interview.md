# Likely Technical Questions
## Statistics
* **How do you approach a Data Science problem?**
  * Domain research and problem formulation: Deep dives with stakeholders, gathering evidence and research surrounding the problem.
  * Gathering data and cleaning
  * Addressing limitations and agreeing about limitations with stakeholders
  * Conducting additional analysis of the data, what is the data saying, do we need to address any challenges with the client and provide background info.
  * Conduct hypothesis and hypothesis testing
  * Determine modelling strategy: Rule out inappropriate models and reduce to several.
  * Run the models against each other with a set of hyper-parameters and cross-validation to determine the most appropriate model
  * Visualise models key metrics and outputs
  * Determine whether to tune or present.

* **Determine the types of hypothesis tests and what is suitable**
  * | Hypothesis Tests | Parameters | Suitability |
    |------------------|-------------|-------------|
    | Chi-Squared test |             | Categorical Data |
    | t-test           |             | Continuous Data  |
    | ANOVA/MANOVA     |             | Both             |
    |  
  * Hypothesis test: Determine the null and alternate hypothesis
  * Determine significance level (alpha) (usually 0.05)
  * Find z-score
  * Find test statistic

* How would you describe a p-value to a non-technical stakeholder?
* How would you describe significance to a non-technical stakeholder?
* How would you describe 
* How do you collect or determine a sample from a population?
* Give an example when you've used hypothesis testing?
* What is the difference between ChiSquared and T-Tests
* When would you use Anova/Manova?
* What is MSE vs SSE when should you use what?
